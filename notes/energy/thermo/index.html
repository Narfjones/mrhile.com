		<h2 class='underlined'>Thermodynamics</h2>
		<p>Thermodynamics is the study of the relations between heat, work, temperature, and energy. The laws of thermodynamics describe how the energy in a system changes and whether the system can perform useful work on its surroundings.</p>
		<h1 class='underlined'>Energy Loss and Gain in a System</h1>
		<br>
		<div class="col-group">
			<div>
				<canvas id="canvas0" width='250' height='445' onclick="particles(this)"> </canvas>
				<br>
				<button id="pause">pause</button>
				<button id="energy">friction: OFF</button>
			</div>
			<div>
				As the ball in the simulation falls, energy transfers from gravitational to kinetic. As it rises, energy transfers from kinetic
				to gravitational.
				<p>Energy is conserved. This means that if we add up the total energy of a system it will always be the same value, unless
					some energy enters or leaves the system we are tracking.</p>
				<p>Turn friction on and observe what happens.</p>
				<br>
				<p>The kinetic energy gradually leaves the ball as it changes into a type of energy called heat.</p>
				<p>
					<strong>Heat</strong> is the random motion of particles. More heat leads to higher temperatures.</p>

			</div>
		</div>
		<p>So the internal energy of a system is always conserved, unless energy enters or leaves our system.</p>
		<div class='definition'>
			<p>The
				<strong>first law of thermodynamics</strong> says that the change in internal energy of a system is equal to heat flow into a
				system plus work done by the system.</p>
			<h1>$$\Delta E = Q - W$$</h1>
			\( E \) = total internal energy of a system [J]
			<br>\( Q \) = Heat, thermal energy added(+) or removed(-) from system [J]
			<br>\( W \) = work done by a system [J]
		</div>

		<div class='example'>
			<b>Example:</b> Compressing a volume of gas does 100 J of work, but at the same time the gas
			<strong>losses</strong> 200 J of heat to the surroundings. What is the change in the internal energy of the gas? Will the gas
			increase of decrease in temperature?
			<details>
				<summary>solution</summary>
				$$\Delta E = Q - W$$ $$\Delta E = -200 - 100$$ $$\Delta E = -300\,\mathrm{J}$$ $$\text{The gas will decrease in temperature}$$
			</details>
		</div>

		<b>Example:</b> A 0.43 kg soccer ball kicked at 10 m/s rolls down a 30 m tall hill. We already solved this problem and got
		a final velocity of 26.2 m/s for the ball.
		<br>
		<br>When actually performing the experiment we found at the bottom of the hill the ball only has a speed of 20.0m/s. Calculate
		the energy loss for the ball. How could the ball have lost energy?
		<details>
			<summary>solution</summary>
			$$\text{energy difference = calculated - experimental}$$ $$\Delta E = \tfrac{1}{2}mv^{2} - \tfrac{1}{2}mv^{2}$$ $$\Delta
			E = \tfrac{1}{2}(0.43)(26.2)^{2} - \tfrac{1}{2}(0.43)(20.0)^{2}$$ $$\Delta E = 147.6\, \mathrm{J} - 86\, \mathrm{J}$$
			$$\Delta E = 61.6 \, \mathrm{J}$$ $$\text{The energy loss was probably from friction.}$$

		<h1 class='underlined' id="entropy">Entropy</h1>
		<p>
			<strong>Entropy</strong> is hard to define because different fields use the term to describe slightly different ideas. The definitions
			of entropy are all loosely centered around disorder. A high entropy system of particles is not organized. A low entropy
			system is very orderly, but how do you measure order?
		</p>
		<p>
			Well, order is whatever you decide. Often order is defined as a concentration of temperature, pressure, volume, or density.
			Many of these concentrations are able to do
			<a href="../../energy/1-intro/index.html#work">work</a>. In the simulation below, the work we want done is rotating the rotor. What state of the system would make the
			rotor turn?
		</p>
		<p>
			Click the clear button to remove the particles. Click inside the simulation to add some particles. Try to place the particles
			in a state that will turn the rotor.

			The system is in high entropy when the particles are evenly spread out. If your system gets in this state, adjust the slider
			to power the rotor from an external power source. The spinning rotor lowers entropy and puts the system back in a state
			that can do work.
		</p>
		<p>
			<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entropy">Entropy</a> plays an important role in thermochemistry, heat transfer, and information theory.</p>

		<!-- <p>
			Entropy can be defined in many other ways. Entropy as dispersal of temperature is useful for understanding engines. If a
			system has high entropy, the temperature is the same throughout the system. A low entropy system might have a sections
			with very low or very high temperature. These pockets of temperature difference can be made to do work, like in a
			<a href="http://www.animatedengines.com/">combustion engine
			</a>.
		</p> -->
		<!-- <p>
			In chemical reactions, entropy is calculated as the ratio of energy to temperature. This give a prediction of free enrgy
			avoidable for a chemical reaction.
		</p> -->

		<!-- <p>
			In chemical reactions, entropy is defined as low before an irreversible reaction or when chemical equilibrium is unbalanced.
			Paper has low entropy before I burn it. After it's been burned, it has high entropy.
		</p> -->
		<!-- <p>
			Energy is required for power plants, cell phones, cars, life. Energy only produces work when a system is in a low entropy
			state as defined by each system. Low entropy for a car is gasoline. A human will not get work from gasoline, we need tacos.
		</p> -->

		<h1 class='underlined'>Arrow of Time</h1>
		<p>
			If you were to watch a video of th Earth orbiting the sun, it would be difficult to tell if the video was running forwards
			or backwards. Simple physical systems don't have a clear forwards or backwards.
		</p>
		<p>
			If you were to watch a glass of water fall off a table, it would be very clear the direction of time. This is because the
			entropy of the glass of water is rapidly increasing.
		</p>
		<p>
			The laws of physics are time reversible. Nature behaves the same moving forwards or backwards in time. The only exception
			is entropy. (also the weak nuclear force)
		</p>
		<div class="definition">
			The second law of thermodynamics states that entropy of an isolated system doesn't decrease over time.
		</div>
		<p>
			The second law is true for all the different formulations of entropy. As time moves forward entropy either increases or stays
			the same. Over time things spread out and move towards a balanced equilibrium. These high entropy states have less ability
			to do work.
		</p>
		<p>
			A human body as a thermodynamics system keeps it's ability to do work by adding low entropy substances, like food, oxygen,
			and water. We also lower our entropy by releasing high entropy substances, like carbon dioxide, urine, and feces.
		</p>
		<p>
			The Earth can be viewed as a thermodynamics system. As time goes on the energy density of Earth spreads out and losses the
			ability to do work. But the Earth isn't isolated. Low entropy light from the sun is added to our system and lowers our
			entropy. High entropy infrared light exits our system as the Earth cools.
		</p>
		<p>
			Inside the Sun, nuclear fusion converts hydrogen into helium and heat. Heat in the form of light strikes the Earth. Sunlight
			is a low entropy source that is harnessed by plants to produce work. We are able to order our world because the system
			of Earth is able to get work out of sunlight.
